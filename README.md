# Game of Life Emulator

This project simulates [John Conway's Game of Life.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) I created it > 5 years ago. If I were to invest more time in this project here are somethings I would like to do:

 - Add functionality to allow users to create their own patterns.
 - Verify accuracy regarding how app behavior is handled around the edges of the grid.
 - Generally add more functionalities like customization, editing the rules for each generation, etc. 
 - Improve performance, so the project can support higher resolution grids. 

 ### Highlights
  - Demonstrates ability to interact with, learn, and implement new APIs in Javascript ([dat.gui]<https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui>)
  - Demonstrates ability to handle large arrays of data (grid is stored in a large 2D array).
  - Demonstrates proficiency in HTML5 Canvas, and Javascript.
